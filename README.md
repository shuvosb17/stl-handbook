This repository contains my personal notes on C++ STL (Standard Template Library), based on the STL lectures from Apna College.
It includes explanations and examples of important STL components like vectors, stacks, queues, maps, sets, and algorithms.
Helpful for revision, competitive programming, and interview preparation.
